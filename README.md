# deconvML package
The advent of single-cell genomics represents a turning point in cell biology. For the first time, we can assay the expression level of every gene in the genome across thousands of individual cells in a single experiment [@trapnell2015defining]. This type of study leads us to ask ourselves questions such as: what cell types does your dataset have? how big are they? what are the most active genes in cell type X? 

To resolve these and many other questions, the deconvML package has been developed. With this package we will be able to know the most relevant information of our datasets, ask different questions that concern the different cell types and tissues that compose it, know the methods that we can apply to our dataset to estimate the active genes and, ultimately, ask which ones are those genes for a certain cell type in a tissue.
